--This is my first scene in GitHub-- script.parent.lua

--I will help and show you how to create scripts (at the end I will show you a unique script) roblox scripts--
--leadeboard script--

game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(Function(plr)
    local a = instance.new("Folder") -- 
    a.Name = "leaderstats"
    a.Parent = Player

    local v = instance.new("IntValue")
    v.Parent = a
    v.Name = "Statser"
    v.Value = 0
end)

**Unique script**

-- Place this script in ServerScriptService if you need this script

local Players = game:GetService("Players")

-- List of items you want to give to players
local items = {
    "Item1", -- Replace with actual items you want to give
    "Item2",
    "Item3",
    "item4"

-- Function to give a random item to the player
local function giveRandomItem(player)
    local randomItem = items[math.random(1, #items)]
    
    -- Replace this with your actual item giving logic.
    -- For example, if these are tools in the game:
    local tool = game.ServerStorage:FindFirstChild(randomItem)
    if tool then
        local clone = tool:Clone()
        clone.Parent = player.Backpack
    end
    
    print(player.Name .. " has received a random item: " .. randomItem)
end

-- Track each player's jump count
local function onCharacterAdded(character)
    local player = Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(character)
    
    if not player then return end
    
    local humanoid = character:WaitForChild("Humanoid")
    local jumpCount = 0

    humanoid.Jumping:Connect(function(isJumping)
        if isJumping then
            jumpCount = jumpCount + 1
            print(player.Name .. " has jumped " .. jumpCount .. " times.")

            if jumpCount >= 10 then
                giveRandomItem(player)
                jumpCount = 0 -- Reset jump count after getting item
            end
        end
    end)
end

-- Listen for new players joining
Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    player.CharacterAdded:Connect(onCharacterAdded)
end)

**Pull items into ServerStorage**

**This should work as expected, giving players a new random item once theyâ€™ve jumped 10 times**
